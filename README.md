## About Me

Hi — I'm Connor, a cybersecurity enthusiast actively building my skills in blue team operations, threat detection, and ethical hacking. I'm currently focused on mastering SOC workflows, writing detections, and breaking stuff in labs to learn how it works.

Looking to join a team where I can contribute to defense, learn from real-world incidents, and grow into a sharp operator.

## Projects & Labs

Blue Team Lab: Homegrown SOC Simulator
  Simulated a small-scale SOC environment using Wazuh, Zeek, and ELK stack on a virtual lab. Parsed logs, built detection rules, and ran live attack emulations.
    - Deployed Suricata for NIDS coverage
    - Wrote custom Sigma rules for brute-force + beaconing
    - Logged and triaged simulated phishing attempt

Evilginx2 + Gophish: Seamless Microsoft 365 Session Hijack Simulation
   Built a full-stack phishing simulation environment using Evilginx2 and Gophish to demonstrate real-world risks of OAuth-based session hijacking in Microsoft 365 Business environments.
     - Deployed a phishing simulation using Gophish and Evilginx2 to emulate OAuth token theft against Microsoft 365 Business accounts
     - Used a public Microsoft phishlet to capture access tokens and session cookies, enabling full account access post-login
     - Achieved MFA bypass through seamless passthrough and domain spoofing
