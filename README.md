## About Me

Hi ‚Äî I'm Connor, a cybersecurity enthusiast actively building my skills in blue team operations, threat detection, and ethical hacking. I'm currently focused on mastering SOC workflows, writing detections, and breaking stuff in labs to learn how it works.

Looking to join a team where I can contribute to defense, learn from real-world incidents, and grow into a sharp operator.
