## 🧠 About Me

Hi — I'm Connor, a cybersecurity enthusiast actively building my skills in blue team operations, threat detection, and ethical hacking. I'm currently focused on mastering SOC workflows, writing detections, and breaking stuff in labs to learn how it works.

Looking to join a team where I can contribute to defense, learn from real-world incidents, and grow into a sharp operator.

## 🧰 Projects & Labs

### 🔹 Blue Team Lab: Homegrown SOC Simulator  
Simulated a small-scale SOC environment using Wazuh, Zeek, and the ELK stack on a virtual lab.  
- Deployed Suricata for NIDS coverage  
- Wrote custom Sigma rules for brute-force and beaconing  
- Logged and triaged a simulated phishing attempt  

### 🔹 Evilginx2 + Gophish: Seamless Microsoft 365 Session Hijack Simulation  
Built a phishing simulation using Evilginx2 and Gophish to demonstrate real-world risks of OAuth-based session hijacking in Microsoft 365 Business environments.  
- Deployed phishing campaign to emulate OAuth token theft in Microsoft 365  
- Used a public Microsoft phishlet to capture access tokens and session cookies  
- Achieved MFA bypass through passthrough and domain spoofing
